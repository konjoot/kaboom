## Proof-Of-Concept

- [x] gRPC Base mock server
- [x] split the functionality into three main parts (encoder, processor, decoder)
- [ ] [encoder] read from stdin, write to stdout encoded message, to stderr - logs and errors:
    - [x] use encoding/binary package for protobuf Encoding\Decoding
    - [x] rules parser for the encoder
    - [x] review Encode
    - [x] tests for Encode (uint, string)
    - [x] try sint for negative numbers
    - [x] understand how to encode negative int32\64 numbers
    - [x] tests and functionality for int32\64 sint32\64
    - [ ] tests and functionality for bytes
    - [ ] tests and functionality for enums
- [ ] [processor] read from stdin, call gRPC, write answer to stdout, to stderr - logs and errors
- [ ] [decoder] read from stdin, write to stdout decoded string, to stderr - logs and errors
- [ ] clean code
- [ ] [encoder] encoding for int64 values
- [ ] [encoder] encoding for string values
- [ ] [encoder] encoding for int32 values
- [ ] [processor] gRPC request processing
