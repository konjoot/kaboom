## Proof-Of-Concept

- [x] gRPC Base mock server
- [x] split the functionality into three main parts (encoder, processor, decoder)
- [x] [encoder] read from stdin, write to stdout encoded message, to stderr - logs and errors:
    - [x] use encoding/binary package for protobuf Encoding\Decoding
    - [x] rules parser for the encoder
    - [x] review Encode
    - [x] tests for Encode (uint, string)
    - [x] try sint for negative numbers
    - [x] understand how to encode negative int32\64 numbers
    - [x] tests and functionality for int32\64 sint32\64
- [x] [processor]:
    - [x] read from stdin, call gRPC, write answer to stdout, to stderr - logs and errors
    - [x] add echo handler in mock gRPC service
    - [x] tests
- [.] [decoder] read from stdin, write to stdout decoded string, to stderr - logs and errors:
    - [ ] runner for decoder, use same rules parser as encoder
    - [ ] decoding integers and strings
    - [ ] tests for decoder.Decode
- [ ] clean code
- [ ] [encoder] improvement:
    - [ ] tests and functionality for bytes
    - [ ] tests and functionality for enums
    - [ ] the same for all supported by proto3 types
    - [ ] change singnature of Encode method to Encode(io.Reader, []Rule, io.Writer) error
- [ ] figure out why grpc.Invoke calls Reset() method on the out interface
